Main question: **How can LLMs enhance doctor-patient communication without replacing the clinician, and what are the associated benefits, risks, and ethical implications.**


#### Project Summary 

Healthcare communication is often characterized by high information complexity, emotional vulnerabiity, and significant power asymmetries between doctors and patients. Patients frequently leave appointments confused about their diagnoses, uncertain about what questions to ask, or unsure about how to follow through on their medical advice. These gaps can lead to worsen health outcomes, increased anxiety, and unequal access to care, particularly for marginalized or low-literacy populations.

This research project explores how large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can be used to support doctor-patient communication **before, during, and after** clinical visits. Focusing on non-diagnostic support tasks, this research paper analyzes the potential for LLMs to act as communication aids and help patients prepare questions, clarify medical language, and practice discussing sensitive topics. 


This research project will look at the effects of using AI  in the context of support by comparing two alternative LLMs: Claude-3.7, a censored AI, and an uncensored LLM. In this context, I will engage in a simulated session where I play the role of the patient and the AI serves as the doctor-patient communication support line.

I performed a literature review to figure out the present state of knowledge on AI's implications regarding therapy and mental health. By combining literary findings with the results from modeled therapy sessions, I plan on contributing to the increasing amount of work on the use of AI in mental health support.
