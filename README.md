Main question: **How can LLMs enhance doctor-patient communication without replacing the clinician, and what are the associated benefits, risks, and ethical implications.**


#### Project Summary 

This research project explores how large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can be used to support doctor-patient communicatio **before, during, and after** clinical visits. FOcusing on non-diagnostic support tasks, this research paper analzes the potential for LLMs to act as communication aids and help patients prepare questions, clarify medical language, and practice discussing sensitive topics. 

* The focus of this project is to either:
  1. Select a theoretical communication framework (e.g. Accomodation Theory) developed to explain human communication behavior and explore its implications for communicating with (in both senses) an LLM.
  2. Examine a specific communicative context or example (e.g. political debate, interaction between customer and service representive, a messaging campaign in health communication, etc.) and explore whether and how LLMs might be used and the associated implications.
 
     
* Write a paper/report in Markdown using Zotero citations.


### Method

* Add notebooks, Markdown files, your BibTex bibliography file, PDFs, images etc. to the repo related to your project.
* The report should be in a Notebook and use the citation extension of JupyterLab to add citations.
* You can render the Notebook to PDF using "Save and Export as" function in JupyterLab.
* You make have additional notebooks or other files to show your empirical LLM work.
