    "As artificial intelligence technologies, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), become increasingly integrated into everyday life, their influence on how people prepare for and understand healthcare interactions is becoming more significant. LLMs such as ChatGPT, Claude, Deepseek, and others are now capable of engaging in fluid, context-aware conversations. This makes them potentially useful tools in helping patients navigate the often overwhelming and highly asymmetrical world of doctor-patient communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doctor visits are typically time-constrained and emotionally charged, with many patients leaving appointments with unanswered questions, misunderstood information, or anxiety about what they should do next. These issues are especially pronounced for individuals with lower health literacy, language barriers, or communication anxiety. In this context, LLMs might offer low-cost, always-available support to help patients prepare for their appointments, clarify medical language, and even practice expressing sensitive concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper focuses on the communicative role LLMs could play in supporting—not replacing—doctor-patient interaction. Drawing from relevant literature and a series of simulated patient-AI interactions, I analyze how current LLMs perform in this role, what kinds of communication they facilitate, and what limitations or risks they pose. My goal is to critically explore how AI might shape the future of healthcare communication from the patient's perspective. \n",

    "For my patient-AI interactions, I will be simulating a patient who recently got diagnosed with stage 4 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and is trying to understand their diagnosis better."

    "To understand the basis of this project and first-hand insight into the experience of using AI chatbots for diagnosis discussions for patients, I wanted to engage with various LLMs to see the difference in their response: **Claude-3.7, ChatGPT-4.1, Deepseek.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To minimize any random variation in responses, I stuck to three questions to prompt each LLM.\n",

    "1. \"I was diagnosed with stage 4 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by my doctor. I'm scared. What is this, how serious is it, what should I do, what should I ask my doctor?\n",
